# Kickstarting with Excel
*Enhance Microsoft Skills**
## Overview of Project
*Exercise Excel prowess. Create two new analyses using advanced Excel skills, like formulas and pivot tables and two charts to visualize data*
### Purpose
1. Evaluate and interpret data by applying excel formulas and pivot tables
2. Visualise big raw data to draw insights and find patterns within the data
## Analysis and Challenges
- Below is the summary of 3 main analysis and challenges:
    1- Mastering Pivot Tables. Even though in the Pivot Tables the information is more organized, there is a challenge in instructing the proper table which helps that purpose, to provide clear data analytics.
    2- Using formulas in excel. Ultimately formulas are cruical in performing tasks automatically helping to translate vision into reality and build the analysis that is in one's head. There is a challenge when using combination of formulas across different ranges and criteris.
    3- Writing the report. Data scientists need to use Github for much the same reason that software engineers do â€” for collaboration,
     'safely' making changes to projects and being able to track and rollback changes over time. However, this is unknown territory for me and everything about it is new. Learning how to use GitHub is on it self a big challenge.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- The outcomes on Launch Data, helped construct an understading of funds allocation for various projects considering the strating date of the projects. The data were grouped, sorted, summarized and organized to show patterns that helped data analysis and informing understanding and decision. The outcome suggested a pattern between succesful and failed projects accross different months, while the cancelled projects exebited more of a linear line. Interestingly successful projects are higher a the beginnning of the months, peaking in May and than decrease in the following months. In December there are as many failed projects as there are successful ones.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-The analysis of outcome based on goals focuses on the projects success with funding. Certain ranges are used for the purpose of analyzing data. It appears that projects with lower funding have a better performance. Due to the small data sample projects with higher funding tend to have more irregular patterns, and do not seem to allow accurate projection. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
1- In the Outcome Based on Launch Date analysis I had some trouble with the pivot regarding filters. They would not show in my pivot, even though every other information was accurate. ~ In the clas hour cooperating with my class friends, I could figured out that I needed a step by step follow up of the assignment, despite same results.
Was able to solve this problem going step by step as mentioned in the learning module. 
2- Submission of the homework in GitHub was also a challenge. Apparently I could not make the proper description among different Git platforms, such as GitHub and GitLab. Thanks to the help provided by the teaching assistant, Caleb in the class hour was able to overcome this difficulty too. Even though theoretically I had the necessary information, submitting the homework and 
>starting to swim as mentioned by the instructor, Dom, ultimately helped me understand these different tools. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. April to July is the most successful period to launching a campaign and May is the best month of the year.
2. September to December is the least successful period to launch a campaign and December is the worst month.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Funding of up to 5,000 has a higher chance of being successful. Increased funds do not translate in higher success, but rather more failure.
2. Some data related to the high funding do not really provide enough information. The sample size is smaller and unreliable. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Does not provide quality or risk measures. Ex. a highly funded project may be more risky. Also there is no return relationship. Ex. a small successful project could bring very little return.
2. The timeline of the project is not taken into consideration. Project with similar outcomes have totally different timelines. 
3. There are less big projects to analyse trends properly.
4. Last 3 years are missing, but they could provide more complete information, especially considering the fast dynamics of today's World.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Life span outcome relationship. 
2. Funding return relationship.
3. Risk funding relationship, including measurable qualitative indicators.
